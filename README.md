2013 FRC Robot

All files and programs related to the FRC 2013 season (that I still have..) can be found on my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz94eU4gW1-3NkswMnpJclZyRUU?usp=sharing">Google Drive here.</a>
If you need any of these please request access and I will absolutely share them. 


<h2>This is the code for the Gentry-FRC 2013/2014 team's robot, Tasha Yar.</h2>
I've uploaded it here for archival purposes mostly, but for the visibility into the code it'self as well. It's not a lot of fun going through all these files in google drive...
